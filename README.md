# Housing-grades-and-redlined-districts
We used current housing data to determine if we could predict the housing grade a property received as well as whether or not it was in a historically redlined district.  Can we build a model using Cook’s County Assessor’s Office (CCAO) data to predict what loan grade (redling indicator) a house was given in 1930 based on the Cook’s county data features today? We also have a sub question: Is house sale price today associated with historical redlining grade data from 1930? In addition to creating our house grade prediction model and mapping its predictions, we also mapped the most expensive and least expensive homes on top of redlined data to see if there are still trends
today from the historical data From the feature modeling, a
particularly interesting finding
that we noticed immediately
was that the “site desirability”
variable in the CCAO dataset
was “2” for every home. This
was surprising because we
assumed that “site desirability” would be the strongest predictor of historical housing grade. Another interesting finding from the decision
tree was that housing “square footage,” “age decade,” and “sale price” were the most predictive
features for determining a house’s 1930’s grade. The feature modeling contour plot (figure 2) shows us that while sale price and plot size are
some of our strongest features, they are not strikingly different for different housing grades. We
interpret this to mean historical redlined grades are not dramatically influencing sale price and lot
size. From mapping the most expensive and least expensive homes (figures 3 and 4), we see most
expensive homes are in historically green or grade A areas and additionally, we see the least
expensive homes were all in historically red or yellow districts (grade C and D). We saw the
most expensive homes are in the northern eastern part of Cook County where historically green
or grade A homes used to be. However, there is also a small concentration of expensive homes in
a historically redlined district in the middle eastern area of Cook County right near the port.
These homes range from $2.8 million to $7 million. This could be because ports are generally
urban centers where people visit often and usually expensive to buy homes in but furthermore,
this location appears to be close to downtown Chicago. With the rise of urbanization especially
in economically successful cities, these areas that were once redlined, have now flipped. The port
area that used to be red but is now home to some of the most expensive properties in Cook’s
County. Overall, wealth appears to be concentrated in this county in these two pockets and
compared to how spread out the least expensive homes were, this highlights a huge wealth
disparity, which could be another reason for the correlation in 1930’s housing grade and sale
price given there is high income
inequality.
